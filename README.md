## Development

The smart contracts are implemented in Solidity `0.4.24` using `Truffle` and `OpenZeppelin` frameworks.

### Prerequisites

* [NodeJS](htps://nodejs.org), version 9+
* [truffle](http://truffleframework.com/), which is a comprehensive framework for Ethereum development. `npm install -g truffle` â€” this should install Truffle v4.1.11 or better.  Check that with `truffle version`.
* [ganache](https://truffleframework.com/ganache), test ethereum local network.

### Initialisation

    npm install

#### From within Truffle

Run the `truffle` development environment

    truffle develop

then from the prompt you can run

    compile
    migrate
    test

as well as other truffle commands. See [truffleframework.com](http://truffleframework.com) for more.

#### Standalone

Start test network (ganache)

    npm run ganache

Run tests
*Because the tests manipulate the EVM you you need to restart ganache after every test and run each test individually.*

    npm run test:token
    npm run test:presale
    npm run test:sale

### Deploying to `ropsten`

You'll need an address on the Ropsten blockchain with some ETH in it.

Use [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) to create a wallet and use [faucet.metamask.io](https://faucet.metamask.io/) to get some ETH for it.

You will need to supply a file called `mnemonic` in the root of the project.

    the sequence of twelve words you used to keep your wallet secure

Then run

    npm run deploy:ropsten
